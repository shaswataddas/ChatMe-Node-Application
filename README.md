# ChatMe Node Application
This is a Chatting Application which is build using Node.js. 

Here we are using [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/v4/#:~:text=Although%20Socket.IO%20indeed%20uses,a%20plain%20WebSocket%20server%20either.) as an external Package which helps to achive the functionality of the Application. 

Socket.IO is a realtime library that enables low latency, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. Socket.IO is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional capabilities such as automatic reconnections, broadcast support, or falling back to HTTP long polling.

# Preview of the Application - 
When we hit the 'Go Live' button from VS code, a new tab open on 'http://127.0.0.1:5500/'. 
According to the code, it first ask for the User Name -

Then when anyone enters the name, then he/she joins the chat server. Also the other chat members get a notification at the same time.
